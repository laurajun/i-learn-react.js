# i-learn-react.js

Sorry about little i. I just can't live with it looking like double l. Heh.

I am very strongly a learning by doing person esp. in coding so I dig into react.js with Udemy, youtube and so on. 
I will recommend good knowledge courses and videos in this moment if I feel I had positive learning experience. 

Here I will document my personal path to Full Stack Developer. 
(I wish there were better touch of big picture in university studies. I know many coder might have experienced the lack of 
interest towards studies because of that). 

# class vs. hooks

Here I try both ways to execute a simple app. 
Maybe I can then get knowledge when it's better use one or the other.
