# i-learn-react.js

Sorry about little i. I just can't live with it looking like double l. Heh.

I am very strongly a learning by doing person esp. in coding so I dig into react.js with Udemy, youtube and so on. 
I will recommend good knowledge courses and videos in this moment if I feel I had positive learning experience. 

Here I will document my personal path to Full Stack Developer. 
(I wish there were better touch of big picture in university studies. I know many coder might have experienced the lack of 
interest towards studies because of that). 

# class vs. hooks

Here I try both ways to execute a simple app. 
Maybe I can then get knowledge when it's better use one or the other. 

# Tetris game with React Hooks

Accidentally I found Thomas Weibenfalks Udemy course for coding React Tetris and I love Tetris. 
I have always loved the game. So, one thing led to another and I'm doing it. 
Thomas has told he is not a game developer but he wanted to test this, so I tought that I'm not either but this is some 
serious fun to learn about Hooks and so on. 

Now I have created the basic game stage and ready to rock = code the actual game!
